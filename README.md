This website is a project for our "Hacking with Python" course at my university. I personally created this website to exploit and later fix its vulnerabilities.

The following aspects were tested/implemented step by step:

    -    Webpage with Flask Login/Register
    -    External bound SQL Database
    -    Page with content from all users for XSS
    -    Two-Factor Authentication when logging in
    -    SQL Injection
    -    Burp testing for instances such as SQL Injection
    -    Fixing SQL Injection
    -    Brute Force with Burp
    -    Brute Force with Selenium
    -    Fixing Brute Force vulnerabilities
    -    XSS with stolen cookies
    -    CSRF scenario
    -    Fixing XSS
    -    Using sessions
    -    Using WTF forms and field validation
    -    Fix for CSRF
    -    Session ID forgery
